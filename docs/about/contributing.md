[Stacklok](https://www.stacklok.com), and we welcome contributions from the
community. There are several ways to contribute to CodeGate, including reporting
bugs, suggesting new features, and submitting pull requests with code changes.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities

If you think you have found a security vulnerability in CodeGate, please DO NOT
disclose it publicly until we've had a chance to fix it. Please don't report
security vulnerabilities using GitHub issues; instead, please refer to the
process outlined in the project's
[security policy](https://github.com/stacklok/codegate/security/policy).

## Creating GitHub issues

GitHub issues are used to track feature requests and bug reports. If you have a
general usage question, please ask in the #codegate channel on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/stacklok). To report a bug or request a feature,
create a new issue in the
[CodeGate GitHub repository](https://github.com/stacklok/codegate/issues).

## Contributing code

If you've found an issue you'd like to work on, you can contribute code to
CodeGate by submitting a pull request. Before you submit a pull request, please
review the
[Pull request process](https://github.com/stacklok/codegate/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-process).
