## Objective

This guide will get you up and running with CodeGate in just a few minutes using
Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot. By the end, you'll have learned how
CodeGate helps to protect your privacy and improve the security of your
applications.

## Prerequisites

You must have an active subscription to
[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

CodeGate runs on Windows, macOS (Apple or Intel silicon), or Linux systems.

Required software:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or Docker
  Engine on Linux)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the
  [GitHub Copilot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)

## Start the CodeGate container

Run CodeGate using Docker:

```bash
docker run --name codegate -d -p 8989:8989 -p 9090:80 -p 8990:8990 --mount type=volume,src=codegate_volume,dst=/app/codegate_volume --restart unless-stopped ghcr.io/stacklok/codegate:latest
```

This pulls the latest CodeGate image from the GitHub Container Registry and
starts the container in detached mode, mapping the necessary ports and mounting
a volume for persistent data storage..

To verify that CodeGate is running, open your web browser and navigate to
`http://localhost:9090`. You should see the CodeGate dashboard.

## Install the CodeGate CA certificate

To enable CodeGate, you must install its Certificate Authority (CA) into your
certificate trust store.

:::info[Why is this needed?]

The CA certificate allows CodeGate to securely intercept and modify traffic
between GitHub Copilot and your IDE. Decrypted traffic never leaves your local
machine.

:::

To install the CodeGate certificate, open the web dashboard in your browser:
http://localhost:9090

From the **Certificates** menu choose **Download**, then click the **Download
Certificate** button. Follow the OS-specific instructions on the page to import
the certificate to your trust store.

## Configure VS Code to use CodeGate

In VS Code, open the Command Palette (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on Windows/Linux) and
search for the **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)** command.

Append the following settings to your configuration:

```json title="settings.json"
{
  // ... Existing settings ... //

  // Note: you may need to add a comma after the last line of your existing settings if not already present

  "http.proxy": "https://localhost:8990",
  "http.proxyStrictSSL": true,
  "http.proxySupport": "on",
  "http.systemCertificates": true,
  "github.copilot.advanced": {
    "debug.useNodeFetcher": true,
    "debug.useElectronFetcher": true,
    "debug.testOverrideProxyUrl": "https://localhost:8990",
    "debug.overrideProxyUrl": "https://localhost:8990"
  }
}
```

:::note

Restart VS Code after adding the proxy configuration.

:::

## Explore CodeGate's key features

To learn more about CodeGate's capabilities, clone the demo repository to a
local folder on your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stacklok/codegate-demonstration
```

:::warning

This repo contains intentionally risky code for demonstration purposes. Do not
run this in a production environment or use any of the included code in real
projects.

:::

Open the project folder in VS Code. You can do this from the UI or in the
terminal:

```bash
cd codegate-demonstration
code ./codegate-demonstration
```

### Protect your secrets

Often while developing, you'll need to work with sensitive information like API
keys or passwords. You've certainly taken steps to avoid checking these into
your source repo, but they are fair game for Copilot to send to its language
models as context.

Open the `conf.ini` or `app.json` file from the demo repo in the VS Code editor.
In the Copilot chat panel, observe that Copilot has automatically loaded the
active file as context.

<ThemedImage
  alt='Copilot chat showing the current file selected'
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      '/img/quickstart/quickstart-copilot-secrets-context-light.webp'
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      '/img/quickstart/quickstart-copilot-secrets-context-dark.webp'
    ),
  }}
  width={'481px'}
/>

Enter this prompt into the chat:

```plain title="Copilot chat"
Explain the current file
```

CodeGate intercepts the request and transparently encrypts the sensitive data
before it leaves your machine.

    light: useBaseUrl(
      '/img/quickstart/quickstart-copilot-secrets-result-light.webp'
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      '/img/quickstart/quickstart-copilot-secrets-result-dark.webp'
    ),
  }}
  width={'800px'}
/>

Learn more in [Secrets encryption](./features/secrets-encryption.md).

### Assess dependency risk

Open the `packages.py` file from the demo repo in the VS Code editor. Confirm
that it's now the active context file in Copilot.

<ThemedImage
  alt='Copilot chat showing the current file selected'
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      '/img/quickstart/quickstart-copilot-dependencies-context-light.webp'
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      '/img/quickstart/quickstart-copilot-dependencies-context-dark.webp'
    ),
  }}
  width={'481px'}
/>

Enter the following prompt into the chat:

```plain title="Copilot chat"
Analyze this file
```

Using its up-to-date knowledge from
[Stacklok Insight](https://www.insight.stacklok.com/), CodeGate identifies the
malicious and deprecated packages referenced in the code.

    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      '/img/quickstart/quickstart-copilot-dependencies-result-dark.webp'
    ),
  }}
  width={'800px'}
/>

### View the dashboard

Open your web browser to [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) and
explore the CodeGate dashboard.

The dashboard displays security alerts and history of interactions between your
AI assistant and the LLM. Several alerts and prompts from the previous steps in
this tutorial should be visible now. Over time, this helps you understand how
CodeGate is actively protecting your privacy and security.

## Clean up your environment

Of course we hope you'll want to continue using CodeGate, but if you want to
stop using it, follow these steps to clean up your environment.

import RemoveCert from './partials/_remove-cert.mdx';

1. Remove the [proxy settings](#configure-vs-code-to-use-codegate) from your VS
   Code configuration.

1. Remove the CodeGate CA certificate from your trust store:

   <RemoveCert />

1. Stop and remove the CodeGate container:

   ```bash
   docker stop codegate && docker rm codegate
   ```

1. Delete the persistent volume:

   ```bash
   docker volume rm codegate_volume
   ```
